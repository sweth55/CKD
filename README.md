**INTRODUCTION**
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a prevalent and serious health condition worldwide, characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. Early detection of CKD is crucial for effective management and intervention to prevent complications such as end-stage renal disease. To address this challenge, advanced machine learning techniques, specifically ensemble learning, have emerged as powerful tools for improving CKD detection accuracy. Ensemble machine learning combines multiple models, such as AdaBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, and Neural Networks, to leverage their individual strengths and enhance predictive performance. By integrating diverse algorithms and considering various clinical parameters and patient demographics, ensemble learning offers a comprehensive 
approach to CKD diagnosis. This project aims to harness the capabilities of ensemble machine learning in identifying key predictive factors, improving model interpretability, and ultimately supporting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions for early CKD detection and patient care.

**. Methods**
The project involves acquiring a comprehensive CKD dataset, conducting data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. Models including AdaBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, and Neural Networks are trained, evaluated, and compared using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Ensemble techniques are employed for robust CKD detection.

**RESULTS**
The results of the project on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) detection using ensemble machine learning techniques were highly promising. After rigorous evaluation and comparison of different models including AdaBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, and Neural Networks, the ensemble model demonstrated superior performance in terms of diagnostic accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ensemble model outperformed individual models and traditional diagnostic methods, showcasing its ability to effectively identify CKD cases and provide valuable insights into key predictive factors. Additionally, feature importance analysis highlighted the significant role of certain clinical parameters and patient demographics in CKD prediction, further enhancing the model's interpretability and clinical relevance. Overall, the results suggest that leveraging ensemble machine learning techniques can significantly improve CKD detection and support informed decision-making in 
healthcare settings.
